# Max-Common-Subgraph
Implementation of the McSplit algorithm whose description is in [1].
It consists of three files. graph.cs for defining graph methods, McSplit.cs which is the main algorithm implementation and Program.cs which is the main function for running the program.
The program uses two graphs in the Examples folder named Graph_G and Graph_H. We can modify both graphs for our purposes.
We can test our program with some random graphs as well with the size of the graph as input in lines 215,216 in the Program.cs file. However, we need to comment on the code for getting graphs from files in lines 210,211 in Program.cs
